It is a framework, such as Rstudio or Tableau that allows you to perform different types of data mining analysis.

We can perform various algorithms such as clustering or classification on your data set and visualize the results itself. It is a framework that provides us better insights for our data and the phenomenon that data represent. Such a framework is called a data mining tool.
